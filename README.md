# Secret Santa Draw 

This website allows you to draw names for a Secret Santa gift exchange. You just need to input the names of four friends and have a fair and fun drawing experience.

  

## Features: 

   * Unique Name Validation: The site does not allow duplicate names, even if they differ only by case (e.g., "Alice" and "alice" are considered the same).
   * Required Field: All four names must be filled in. The draw will not proceed if the field is empty or incomplete.
   * Draw: Once all names are entered correctly, proceed with the draw to see who is matched with whom.
   * Re-draw Option: If you're not happy with the initial draw, you can easily restart and draw again.
